# DetectAttackables

## Why it was written

Because we want things to be attacked. The attack itself just renders the sprite and the collider (as a trigger). Here we check what the collider is coming across.
___

## What it does

Whenever something enters the trigger, it checks if it will be affected by the attack (through it having DetectAttack), and it invokes it with the time the attack has been going on.
___

## How to use it

Just attach it to the same thing that has [[Attack]].
