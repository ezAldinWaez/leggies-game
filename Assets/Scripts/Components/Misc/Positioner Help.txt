Hallo~! Here I will tell you how to use the positioner.
The script will position the UI element depending on the size of the screen, so it can respond to any screen size.
The two points you have to enter, xMin, yMin, and xMax, yMax are percents of the screen 
that will pinpoint a space for the element to occupy.
For example, you have a button that you want to occupy the last vetical 10% of the screen. 
You assign the Positioner to it, and you fill it:
XMin: 0
XMax: 1
YMin: 0
YMax: 0.1

Good Luck and have fun!
